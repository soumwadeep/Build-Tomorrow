        <p>Health and Hygiene are two essential concepts when it comes to the human body. Health refers
to the state of physically as well a mental well being. Health also encompasses the social well
being of an individual. Health is not just about being fit but also having the appropriate
resources to live. Having a sound body and mind is an indication of good health.
Hygiene refers to maintaining good health through practices that focus on cleanliness. Good
Hygiene helps to prevent the spread of diseases and illnesses. Hygiene and health go hand in
hand. In today’s world, where pollution levels are rising and numerous diseases emerging, good
health and Hygiene are a necessity.</p>

<p>Health refers to a person’s overall well-being and focuses not just on one’s physical state but
the mental and social state as well. Physical fitness refers to the bodily conditions and state of
health with the absence of diseases. Mental health is the well-being of a person’s psychological
state, which is free from mental illness and having good cognitive health. Social well being is a
person’s capability to form and maintain relationships in their lives. The World Health
Organization adds to this definition by stating that health does not just refer to the objective of
living but also resources for everyday life. Having a sound body and mind constitutes good
health.</p>

<p>Hygiene correlates to health. Hygiene refers to practices to ensure that we have good health.
These practices focus on cleanliness, clean environment and nutritious diets, all of which are
important to the human body personal and social hygiene help to protect our bodies from
illnesses. Building a robust immune system requires good health with proper Hygiene.
A nutritious diet is a prerequisite to good health. A balanced diet involves consuming different
kinds of foods like fruits, vegetables, staples, legumes and proteins. Fruits and vegetables
contain minerals and vitamins that are important for the body. Drinking fluids help to keep our
bodies hydrated. They flush out the toxins and make us stronger. Fats, oils and sugars provide
us with energy, but we must consume them in limited quantities. Some people also include meat
into their diet, which has sufficient protein. Dairy products have calcium that helps strengthen
bones. Washing fruits and cooking vegetables before consumption is essential for Hygiene.
Pure drinking water keeps us hydrated and helps in the functioning of our organs and removing
toxins. Untreated and impure water causes many diseases. Boiling water or adding purifying
agents help to clean the water for drinking.</p>

<p>Cleanliness is an essential hygienic practice towards being healthy. Showering regularly and
wearing clean clothes is one form of personal Hygiene. Washing hands frequently, cutting nails,
and brushing as well as flossing are some ways through which we can have good personal
Hygiene.</p>

receive treatment. Contaminated water is the breeding ground for many water-borne diseases
like typhoid and cholera. Proper sewage systems help to prevent this. Defecation in open places
is very unhygienic and unhealthy. Dumping garbage on the roads attracts many insects which
can be harmful to the surrounding. Adoption of proper garbage disposal will help to reduce this
problem. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in India is one such initiative to promote environmental
Hygiene by promoting adequate garbage disposal and aiming for a cleaner India.</p>

to strengthen our body and make us immune to diseases; by adopting healthy practices are not
just benefit individuals but the society as well. We need to spread awareness of hygienic
practices. A healthy community helps a nation grow more robust.</p>
